## 💡 TIPS & HINTS

**Priority Color Coding:**
```css
.priority-low { border-left: 4px solid #28a745; }
.priority-medium { border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; }
.priority-high { border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; }
```

**Filter Function:**
```javascript
function getFilteredTasks() {
  let filtered = tasks;
  
  if (currentFilter === 'active') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(t => !t.completed);
  } else if (currentFilter === 'completed') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(t => t.completed);
  }
  
  return filtered;
}
```
