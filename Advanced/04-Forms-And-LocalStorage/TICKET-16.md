## 💡 TIPS & HINTS

**Safe Load Pattern:**
```javascript
function loadCards() {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('studyCards');
  
  if (saved) {
    studyCards = JSON.parse(saved);
  } else {
    studyCards = [];
  }
}
```

**Random Card:**
```javascript
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quizCards.length);
const randomCard = quizCards[randomIndex];
```

**Progress Bar:**
```javascript
const percent = total === 0 ? 0 : Math.round((mastered / total) * 100);
progressFill.style.width = percent + '%';
```
